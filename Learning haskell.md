## Setup

Read instructions here: [HaskellStack:README](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

A simple hello world

```haskell
--file: hello.hs
main = do
	print "hello world"
```

To run it: (for mac, just use `stack`)

```bash
# to compile
stack ghc hello.hs

./hello # to run
"hello world"
```

#### Learning Resources

I looked into "learn you a haskell for greater good". found it lacking in terms of practical examples. I tried to follow `Haskell school of music` , but got lost in music concepts.

Now, following `Get programming with haskell` from Manning.

Chapter 1 -

- restrictions on a function:
	- A function must always take an argument.
	- A function must always return a value.
	- Calling the same function with the same argument must always return the same result.‚Äù

- Lambda functions- anonymous functions eg:

	```haskell
	
	```
