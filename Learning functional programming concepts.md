# Functional programming concepts

### Lambda calculus

- Look into lambda calculus (Church (Turing's advisor) came up with with it) Apparently you can represent any computable functions with it; and equivalent to Turing machines.

	- There was also an idea of recursive functions which could capture any computation

	- Eventually i think turing figured out all 3 are equivalent (heard on some podcast)

		

- Looked at [A Tutorial introduction to lambda calculus](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf) to get a taste of it; I got lost in those symbols/lambda definitions of successors and other operators; not sure how anyone came up with those.

- The paper linked me to this book: [An introductuction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831) ; bought it, reading it currently;
