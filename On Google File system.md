- **Key observations:**

  - Single master architecture (but master state replicated in case master goes down)


  - client use a library to manage interactions with the file system
  - Read is straightforward; client gets chunk servers for a file from master and pings the nearest chunk server.
  - Write is pretty complicated, doesn't guarantee **strong consistency**

    - For each write; there's a primary and secondaries
    - two steps: client transmits data, gets ack and then sends append request; primary applies the *mutation* first and forwards the *mutation* request to secondaries; all primary and secondary must append for write to be successful
    - It could happen that some replicas have appended and some haven't; in this case the write is marked failure and client is expected to retry. 
    - When retries successful, can end up with replicas with data in different order (since its append only, if a replica previously appended, it will append again on rety)
    - can end up with inconsistent replica if the client dies before retrying. (some replicas would extra data than others- extra being data from failed writes)
    - Lease: handle split brain scenario; if master and primary got partitioned, it will only last for lease duration in worst case.


  - Issues:
    - single master load, running out of RAM
    - client is expected to handle inconsistencies,  more responsibilities on client
    - human intervention needed when master failed
